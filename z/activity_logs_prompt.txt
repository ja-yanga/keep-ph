Activity Logs – Prompt List
Architecture & Design

“Design a centralized activity_logs table for an append-only audit trail.”

“Define a scalable activity logging architecture for admin, user, and system actions.”

“Propose a naming convention for activity log actions (past-tense, consistent).”

“Decide what data should go into metadata vs dedicated columns for activity logs.”

Database & Schema

“Create SQL schema for an activity_logs table with indexes optimized for filtering.”

“Add JSON metadata support for before/after state changes.”

“Define indexes for high-volume audit logs without impacting write performance.”

“Ensure the activity log table is append-only and audit-safe.”

Logging Utility / Service

“Create a reusable logActivity() helper for a Next.js backend.”

“Design a logging service that never breaks core flows if logging fails.”

“Auto-capture actor, IP address, and user agent when logging actions.”

“Standardize log payload structure across all features.”

Admin & System Actions

“Log package status updates using activity logs.”

“Log KYC approval and rejection events with metadata.”

“Log reward lifecycle events (sent, revoked, failed).”

“Log payment success and failure events with provider metadata.”

“Log admin-initiated user actions such as password resets.”

User Actions

“Log user password change events without storing sensitive data.”

“Log profile updates and record only changed fields.”

“Log profile picture uploads without persisting unstable URLs.”

“Log user address add, update, and delete actions.”

“Correctly distinguish actor vs affected entity in user-related logs.”

Security & Compliance

“Audit activity logs for sensitive data leaks.”

“Define which user actions must be logged for compliance.”

“Prevent activity logs from storing PII or secrets.”

“Ensure activity logs are tamper-resistant.”

Querying & Admin UI

“Build an admin activity log viewer with filters and pagination.”

“Query activity logs by actor, entity, action, and date range.”

“Optimize activity log queries for large datasets.”

“Design a readable description field for non-technical admins.”

Testing & Validation

“Write tests to ensure activity logs are created on state changes.”

“Verify activity logs for admin vs user vs system actions.”

“Test logging behavior during partial failures.”

“Validate metadata accuracy for before/after updates.”

Documentation & Maintenance

“Document supported activity log actions and their meanings.”

“Create guidelines for adding new activity log entries in future features.”

“Define log retention and archival strategy.”

“Create a checklist for adding activity logging to new modules.”
